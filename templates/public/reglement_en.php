<P class="p0 ft0">Rules of procedure of the 2020</P>
<P class="p1 ft0">Challenge Grande Ecoles Centrale</P>
<P class="p2 ft0">Lyon</P>
<P class="p3 ft2"><SPAN class="ft1">The Challenge Grandes Écoles is a </SPAN>sports event, based on pleasure and sharing<SPAN class="ft1">. Although the Challenge has been taking place for many years, it remains a fragile event which needs to be approached with caution by all its participants.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p4 ft1">The campus of École Centrale Lyon was obviously not built to welcome such a sports event. <SPAN class="ft2">The constraints created by the Challenge are important </SPAN>and require a very careful preparation. Therefore, we have to impose some rules on each of our guests. The present rules of procedure have the purpose of informing the participants about the measures enforced on campus during the <NOBR>week-end</NOBR> of Challenge Grandes Écoles 2020. The signature of this document means a full accepting of its content, particularly of the sanctions linked to the breaking of any rule of procedure.</P>
<P class="p5 ft4">Section 1 : <SPAN class="ft3">Behavior</SPAN></P>
<P class="p6 ft1">The Challenge is a great <SPAN class="ft2">sports event</SPAN>, with a lot of constraints. That is why each participant commits to have a <SPAN class="ft2">responsible behavior </SPAN>during the event. He or she also commits to respect the indications given by the organizing team of the Challenge, by the staff of Ecole Centrale de Lyon and by the members of its own sport association. Each sport association has to <SPAN class="ft2">monitor their school’s participants</SPAN>.</P>
<P class="p7 ft1">Every participant agrees to give his ID if requested by any member of the organizing team of the Challenge (organizing students team, staff of Ecole Centrale Lyon, members of USE ECL, security staff, etc.).</P>
<P class="p8 ft1">During the whole week end, the organizing team of the Challenge reserves the right to expel any person who displays an inappropriate behavior from the event (during tournaments or evening party). The costs to take him back to his school will be paid by its own or by the sport association of the school.</P>
<P class="p9 ft6">Section 2 : <SPAN class="ft5">Insurance and medical certificate</SPAN></P>
<P class="p10 ft2">Participants with a FFSU licence</P>
<P class="p11 ft1">Each participant will have to give his/her FFSU licence number.</P>
<P class="p12 ft1">Participants certify on their honor to have a <SPAN class="ft2">liability insurance </SPAN><NOBR>(third-party</NOBR> insurance) during the Challenge Centrale Lyon on 21<SPAN class="ft7">st </SPAN>and 22<SPAN class="ft7">nd </SPAN>March 2020.</P>
<P class="p13 ft2">Participants without a FFSU licence</P>
<P class="p14 ft1">Each participant will give to the organizing team a medical certificate allowing him to practice the sport for which he is registered in the competition (under 6 month of validity ). He will also give an attestation of a <SPAN class="ft2">liability insurance </SPAN><NOBR>(third-party</NOBR> insurance).</P>
<P class="p15 ft2">For foreign participants</P>
<P class="p16 ft1"><SPAN class="ft1">-</SPAN><SPAN class="ft8">Participants coming from an EU country must be in possession of the European Health Insurance card and must have taken out insurance for medical repatriation.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p17 ft1"><SPAN class="ft1">-</SPAN><SPAN class="ft9">For, participants coming from a foreign country which is not part of the EU, the issue of a VISA is conditioned to the issue of a repatriation insurance.</SPAN></P>

<P class="p11 ft2">For “former students” of Ecole Centrale Lyon</P>
<P class="p18 ft1">Each participant must give to the organizing team a medical certificate, issued at most 6 month before the competition, allowing him to practice the sport for which he is registered in the competition.</P>
<P class="p10 ft1">Being in possession of an RC and corporal damage insurance is strongly recommended.</P>
<P class="p19 ft10">We remind all the Sport committees of the universities invited to the competition that they must make sure that all their participants will be in possession of a sport license during the event.</P>
<P class="p20 ft11">Warning ! If these documents are not given before March 8th 2020, the participants at fault will automatically be expelled from the tournament, without any possibility of a refund.</P>
<P class="p21 ft6">Section 3 : <SPAN class="ft5">Invoice procedure</SPAN></P>
<P class="p10 ft1">Any disrespectful behavior towards goods or people will be punished.</P>
<P class="p22 ft1">If <SPAN class="ft2">any damages </SPAN>are caused during the event, the organizing team of the Challenge will bill the Sport Association or the marching band of the school responsible with the corresponding cost, if the group is proved guilty. The corresponding amount will be taken from the deposit given by the Sport Association.</P>
<P class="p23 ft10">If <SPAN class="ft12">any damages </SPAN>are caused in the tents or in the room of a student residence, the organizing team of the Challenge will bill the contestant with the amount of the corresponding cost. The corresponding amount will be taken from the deposit of the contestant.</P>
<P class="p24 ft1">If it is impossible to find out which school is responsible for the damages, the fees for these damages will be charged <SPAN class="ft2">to all schools</SPAN>, proportionally with the number of participants of each school. The corresponding amount will be taken from the deposit given by the Sport Associations.</P>
<P class="p25 ft4">Section 4 : <SPAN class="ft3">Use of the Participant Card</SPAN></P>
<P class="p26 ft1">A participant card is distributed to each participant. It can be recharged at the time of registration on the Challenger, and throughout the weekend on the recharging stands (CB/Lydia/Species) and on the Challenger (Lydia). It allows the purchase of drinks and food, as well as access to the university restaurant for Full Packages. No transactions will be accepted other than through this card outside the reload stands. <SPAN class="ft2">The participant card is personal and </SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft2">non-transferable.</SPAN></NOBR></P>
<P class="p27 ft10">The organizing team commits to transfer all the money given by the participants on their respective cards. At the end of the weekend, the organizing team will repay the amount of money left on the card to the participant <SPAN class="ft12">only if the participant reloaded this sum using Lydia</SPAN>.</P>
<P class="p28 ft6">Section 5 : <SPAN class="ft5">Identification</SPAN></P>
<P class="p29 ft10">All participants of the Challenge 2020 must have their <SPAN class="ft12">participant card </SPAN>and the <SPAN class="ft12">bracelet(s) </SPAN>given to them for the event. They have to carry their bracelets from their arrival on Friday March 20th to the end of the event on Sunday March 22th. Bracelets will be given at the arrival on the campus.</P>
<P class="p30 ft1">If a participant loses his bracelets or his card, <SPAN class="ft2">he has to report it to a member of the organizing team </SPAN>of the Challenge. His previous card will be deactivated and a new card will be activated for him with the amount of money he had on the lost card. The cost of the new card will be charged to the participant.</P>
<P class="p31 ft10">Each Sport Association and marching band must <SPAN class="ft12">control the number of participants from their school before arriving on campus</SPAN>. They will <SPAN class="ft12">sign the nominative list of the participants on their arrival </SPAN>to make sure that the incoming participants are actually the ones on the list.</P>
<P class="p15 ft2">It is strictly forbidden to come with unregistered people. Sanctions will be taken against</P>

<P class="p11 ft2">people without a proper registration and the school they come from.</P>
<P class="p32 ft6">Section 6 : <SPAN class="ft5">Bringing Alcohol</SPAN></P>
<P class="p33 ft2">It is <SPAN class="ft13">strictly forbidden </SPAN>to bring alcohol on the campus, on the sport facilities or during the evenings<SPAN class="ft1">. Every member of the Challenge team and the security team will seize any alcoholic substance they find and its containing.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p34 ft1"><SPAN class="ft2">On the day of the arrival</SPAN>, security members will check that participants have no alcohol. If found, it will be taken and not returned to its owner.</P>
<P class="p13 ft1">Sanctions may be taken against the participants and their schools if they don’t respect this rule.</P>
<P class="p35 ft6">Section 7 : <SPAN class="ft5">Alcohol consumption</SPAN></P>
<P class="p36 ft2">Alcohol consumption on the campus and sport facilities is strictly forbidden outside the “party area” on Saturday and outside party hours, meaning from 9 p.m. on Saturday, March 21th to 5 p.m. on Sunday, March 22th.</P>
<P class="p37 ft1">The alcohol consumption must not be more than 3 standard units of alcohol, according to the recommendations of the WHO and pursuant to the CDEFI/CGE charter.</P>
<P class="p38 ft1">During the whole weekend, underaged participants are not allowed to consume alcohol in any form whatsoever.</P>
<P class="p39 ft6">Section 8 : <SPAN class="ft5">Collective Vigilance</SPAN></P>
<P class="p40 ft1">To avoid any unfortunate incident, the entire Challenge Centrale Lyon team relies on everyone to take responsibility for their alcohol consumption during the evening. Their alcohol consumption must not exceed 3 standard drink in agreement with the Word Health Organization’s recommendations and with the CDEFI/CGE charter. Each participant must be active in the principle of <SPAN class="ft2">Collective Vigilance</SPAN>. A supervision is set up during the evening of Saturday (Red Cross and Rest Zone), all participants must react to a situation of danger, and intervene by using the means set up by the organizers.</P>
<P class="p41 ft1">In the same way, the whole organizing team counts on each participant’s efforts to counter sexual assaults and all sexist behaviors. This year, students in charge of these issues will be mobilized in order to prevent theses violence from happening (sexist insult, sexual exhibition, sexual assaults, sexual harassment). If you are the victim or if you witness such a behavior do not hesitate to get in touch with one of these students.</P>
<P class="p42 ft1">The whole Challenge Centrale Lyon team will be particularly vigilant to this kind of incident and any assault will be severely punished according to the law.</P>
<P class="p4 ft1">Although plenty of measures have been implemented, this does not make all participants’ vigilance any less necessary. The organizing team counts on every participant to react, intervene and warn the team in charge of these issues if they witness any dangerous situation.</P>
<P class="p43 ft6">Section 9 : <SPAN class="ft5">Thefts and losses</SPAN></P>
<P class="p44 ft1">Ecole Centrale Lyon, USE ECL and the organizing team of the Challenge cannot be held accountable for any thefts or losses.</P>

<P class="p45 ft4">Section 10 : <NOBR><SPAN class="ft3">Eco-responsibility</SPAN></NOBR></P>
<P class="p46 ft1">Participants of Challenge Centrale Lyon 2020 commit to have an <SPAN class="ft2">ecoresponsible </SPAN>behavior. They will not let wastes on the ground, they will <SPAN class="ft2">sort waste to recycle it if possible</SPAN>, and throw each type of waste in the appropriate bin.</P>
<P class="p47 ft1">During the evening parties, every participant must use <NOBR>eco-cups,</NOBR> to limit waste of goblets. <SPAN class="ft2">One and only one </SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft2">eco-cup</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft2"> </SPAN>will be given to each participant for free. <SPAN class="ft2">Any other </SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft2">eco-cup</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft2"> will be charged.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p48 ft4">Section 11 : <SPAN class="ft3">Housing</SPAN></P>
<P class="p49 ft1">Men will be housed in tents. Women will be housed in the rooms of a student residence as far as possible. We cannot guarantee that every woman will be housed in apartments.</P>
<P class="p50 ft2">It is highly recommended to bring a mattress, a sleeping bag and warm clothes<SPAN class="ft1">. According to participants who came last year “In Lyon, nights are cold, and the ground is hard”.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p51 ft6">Section 12 : <SPAN class="ft5">Sports competition</SPAN></P>
<P class="p52 ft10">The Challenge's competition is not mixed in most sports. Indeed, the Challenge team has decided to organize separated men and women tournaments in some sports. In these disciplines, each participants must <SPAN class="ft12">only register in the tournament matching with his gender</SPAN>.</P>
<P class="p53 ft4">Section 13 : <NOBR><SPAN class="ft3">Fair-play</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft3"> behavior</SPAN></P>
<P class="p54 ft1"><NOBR>Anti-sports</NOBR> attitude is prohibited during the tournament. Respecting the games and the opponents is a key value of Challenge Centrale Lyon.</P>
<P class="p55 ft1">By <NOBR>Fair-play,</NOBR> the Challenge Centrale Lyon means an <SPAN class="ft2">honest conduct of the game </SPAN>: respect of the opponents, the rules, the referee’s decisions, the public and the game’s spirit, but also loyalty, <NOBR>self-control</NOBR> and dignity in victory as well as in defeat.</P>
